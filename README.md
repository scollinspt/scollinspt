### Hi, I’m Sean Collins  

Professor & Director, School of Health at Plymouth State University  
Founding Director, Doctor of Physical Therapy Program  

My scholarship is focusing on the foundations of scientific inquiry—particularly the mathematical and conceptual structure underlying how we model evidence, uncertainty, and complex systems. On GitHub, I build and experiment with computational tools that illuminate these structures: frameworks for causal modeling, information representation, complex systems, and conceptually grounded approaches to understanding data and models.
