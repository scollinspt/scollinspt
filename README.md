### Hi, I’m Sean Collins  

Professor & Director, School of Health at Plymouth State University  
Founding Director, Doctor of Physical Therapy Program  

My work explores the foundational structures that shape causality, inference, and scientific understanding. Drawing from systems theory, human factors engineering, and critical realism, I’m interested in how the organization of complex worlds—and the biological and technological systems through which we engage them—determine what can be known and how knowledge develops.

On GitHub, I build and experiment with computational tools that illuminate these structures: frameworks for causal modeling, information representation, complex systems, and conceptually grounded approaches to understanding data and models.

### **Current Directions**
- Exploring the interface between **scientific inquiry and engineered systems**  
- Developing conceptual and computational tools to clarify **causality, inference, and knowledge organization**  
- Using Python and modern AI frameworks to prototype systems that reveal how structure shapes understanding  

### **Background**
ScD in Ergonomics / Human Factors Engineering with longstanding interests in systems theory, epistemology, critical realism, biological organization, and the architecture of explanation.
