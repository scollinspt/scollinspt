- 👋 Hi, I’m @scollinspt
- 👀 I’m interested in football (soccer) analytics specifically that merge data and sports science and as a paradigm for studying causal inferences for decision making in complex and unique situations.
- 🌱 I’m currently working to improve my programming skills in R and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with soccer analytics, including a meta-study on the impact of soccer analytics on the game
